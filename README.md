Hello! And welcome to this repository of SQL projects. Those are projects that I do for **learning** or for *fun*, so feel free to use them whatever you want. I will be updating content here from time to time.

The next is a list of the projects that are in this repository. This list may not be exhaustive:

1. Create a table
2. New York Restaurants

From time to time I do some projects that are difficult to convey in a specific set of files, so I don't put them here, but normally I upload them all.

See you!
