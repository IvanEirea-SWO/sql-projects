Hello! And welcome to this repository of SQL projects and SQL related content also. Those are projects that I do for **learning** or for *fun*, so feel free to use them whatever you want. I will be updating content here from time to time. ðŸ› 

The next is a list of the projects that are in this repository. This list may not be exhaustive:

1. Create a table
2. New York Restaurants
3. Codey's Confectionery: Preventing SQL Injection Attacks

Codey's Confectionery: Preventing SQL Injection Attacks is writen in JavaScript but is a bunch of code that has relation with SQL injection attacks and their prevention, as its name suggests, so because of that, and because it actually has some SQL code inside, it is here in this repo. The name of this file that I'm talking about is app.js, by the way. 

From time to time I do some projects that are difficult to convey in a specific set of files, so I don't put them here, but normally I upload them all.

See you! ðŸ–¥
